Lox language implementation.

## About

Implementation of the Lox language from the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). Big thanks to Robert Nystrom for the great book!

The implementations here are similar to the original ones. The purpose of this repo is to follow along the book and make the concepts stick. Check out the [craftinginterpreters repo](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters) to see the original implementation in its final form.
